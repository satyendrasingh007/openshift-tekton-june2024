- SCRUM Daily stand-up meeting is a fail-fast meeting
- SCRUM Daily stand-up meeting is an inspect and adapt meeting
- similar to SCRUM daily stand-up, the equivalent engineering process is the Continuous Integration
- the source code has to integrated several times a day
- for the CI to work effectively, the automated build should involve automated test cases
- the team should have a culture, where build failures due to test case failure are treated as a good thing, and the management appreciates when such builds are broken
- build failure is the feedback your CI gives us, it found a bug during the early stage of development
- in CI builds, we need to automate builds along with unit and integration testing
